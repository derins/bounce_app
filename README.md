# Bounce

by Alex Castillo and Derin Serbetcioglu

- Bounce is an app for event management. After downloading the app, you can create an account and log in with that username.
- At the main page, you will have an empty list of events which can be populated by clicking the "Create Event" button at the top right.
- You can add guests to the event by clicking "Invite Guests"
- After guests are invited and the event is saved, a QR code is generated for each guest and is texted to each invitee
- From the main page, you can click on any of the events to edit the details
- From the Edit Event screen, you can view the guest list, but can't make changes (since a QR code was already sent and it would be rude to rescind the invite)
- From the main page, you can click the "Bounce" icon to open a QR-scanning screen - this can be used to scan guest QR codes at the door of the event
- Swiping right from the QR scanning screen returns you to the main event page
